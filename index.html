<h1>week 01 reading response! :)</h1>
<main>As we think offered such an intriguing insight to what scientists and engineers assumed would proceed based on the knowledge they had at the time. The author was describing a machine that would be able to index tangible things such as newspapers and magazines in a way similar to how a human brain would index memories. The author also focused a lot of the speed of the machines and how most machines that work at fast speed are problem solving machines. I also think how integrated the senses and computation were from the author’s perspective. Within Long Live the Web, the focus on the internet being a place of true force of egalitarianism within modern society. The author also discusses how the “founding principles” of the internet are being threatened by a few forces. These forces include companies attempting to monopolize platforms, service providers wanting to repeal net neutrality, and companies creating”walled off” platforms that aren’t accessible.
